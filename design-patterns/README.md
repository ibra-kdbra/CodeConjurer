### Places Where Example Sways from book

1. Abstract Factory Pattern: Example sways from the example given in the playlist (that of UI components) or the book (Pizza shop) and introduces a clothes factory for work clothes and day-off clothes.

2. Command Pattern: Example slightly sways from playlist (remote for smart lamp) and introduces an AC remote. Not quite sure about the implementation of this example.

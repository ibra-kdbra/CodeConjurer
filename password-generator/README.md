# CPP-password-generator

A CLI password generator coded in C++.

## Status: In development

At the moment the features are minimal and the random number generator is __not secure__.

Until this is fixed __do not use this password generator__ to protect sensitive information as the psuedorandom numbers generators are predictable.

To run:

- Download pg.cpp,
- Run `g++ -o pg.out pg.cpp`,
- A file named `pg.out` should be created,
- Run this file. This can be achieved using `./pg.out`.

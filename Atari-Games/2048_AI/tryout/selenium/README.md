# Selenium Demo

It's recommended you go to this [website](https://ibra-kdbra.github.io/JS_game_collections/2048/index.html) for a demo instead.

To set up the Selenium demo, set up a virtual environment in the `demo/selenium` directory and run `venv/bin/pip install .`.
By default, the demo runs in the Firefox browser.
To run in Firefox, you may need to install the `geckodriver` executable.

The code in [main.py](/demo/selenium/main.py) should be editable so that it works for any webdriver-supported browser.
It's worth noting that it takes a while for the page to load up in Chrome, which is why Firefox is the default.

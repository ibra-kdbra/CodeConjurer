# A* Search Algorithm

* Implemented an A* grid-based search algorithm.
  * The searching behavior a *BFS like algorithm* to visit priority of neighbor nodes w/ higher ```int f``` value, which is a dynamic value relate to its current node during the search process, that equals to the sum of ```int h (Heuristic)``` and ```int g``` value, i.e., ```f(n) = g(n) + h(n)```.
  * A set of tests is provided by Udacity and have been passed using such implementation.

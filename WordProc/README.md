# Word Processor Desktop Application

An attempt to write a word processor using **C++20**, **Qt5**, and CMake as the build system.<br> The idea is to use a **MDI** approach and the documents
support *Qt* has already builtin for exporting (*Qt* does not include reading
support),<br> but later add own document formats to ***write/read*** documents
including more then formatted text.

# C++ Projects **PlayGround**

### I made this repo to make more C++ projects and implement new things I always wanted to try.

### **This repo** will may contain some forked and cloned repo from other users, their credit will be found in every *README* of each directory and it will be edited to my need.

### I hope this repository never stops growing, and teaches me new things about this fascinating programming language.

#### **I hope in feeding back to it**

Update, made two related screen savers with C-programming language(Pipes_ScreenSaver)(Matrix_ScreenSaver), also training with some algorithms in the SimpleCode directory, this will be helpful.

## Overview
This repository serves as a personal playground for experimenting with various C++ projects. It includes original implementations, as well as **forked** or **cloned** repositories from other developers **with my own improvements** where applicable. Each project aims to explore different concepts and features of the C++ programming language.


### Side note:
Projects are organized alphabetically for easy navigation. Each corresponding *README* file provides specific details, usage instructions, and credits for any borrowed code.

 A shell script designed to streamline the process of compiling and executing C (and C++) scripts with unparalleled speed. This tool allows users to run C code directly from the command line or via shebang, making it as convenient as running shell scripts. With support for multiple files and customizable compiler options.

#

### [CanChat](./canChat)
Feature-complete rooms-based chat for tens of thousands of users. Client plus Server. Built with [Oat++ Web Framework](https://oatpp.io/).
`Single-Node` `In-Memory` `WebSocket` `TLS`.
<div align="right"> 
<a href="#projects-titles"> 📚 </a>
</div>

#
### [Chess_3D](./Chess_3D)

A simple 3D chess game that depends on GLFW and GLM, with U-R-C-F for game controls.
<div align="right"> 
<a href="#projects-titles"> 📚 </a>
</div>

#

### [Chess-Engine](./Chess_Engine)

A Chess Engine implemented in C++17.
<div align="right"> 
<a href="#projects-titles"> 📚 </a>
</div>

#

### [Collatz-Conjecture](./Collatz)

[Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) about the Collatz Conjecture.

A program that attempts to solve the Collatz Conjecture question, which asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one.
<div align="right"> 
<a href="#projects-titles"> 📚 </a>
</div>

#

### [CPP20_Develop](./CPP20_Develop)

`A versatile collection of compile-time optimized tools for C++ programming.`

This library uses the latest C++ features available in GCC, Clang and Visual Studio 2019 and 2022.

Co-Cpp19 contains numerous sublibraries and is splitted into many small headers.
This aims to enable the "pay only what you use policy" of C++ at compile time.
<div align="right"> 
<a href="#projects-titles"> 📚 </a>
</div>


#

### [CustomizedOperators](./CustomizedOperators)

Implements custom operators for C++.

#### Like what?
In C++, one cannot create new operators such as `<>` or `|&`. However, you can create a variable named `x` of a newly created type with an irrelevant name and overload the operators `<` and `>` so that you can write `< x >`, creating new operators of sorts.
<div align="right"> 
<a href="#projects-titles"> 📚 </a>
</div>

#

### [Define_evil](./define_evil)

*A macro library for the morally compromised C and C++ programmer.*

It's an MIT-licensed collection of clean, modular, well-documented macro hacks with full unit test coverage.

**Why?**

Complex macros are useful when pushing the limits of what C/C++ can do. For example, you could use `#define EVIL` macros to construct a domain-specific language that is technically C or C++ (compiled by any normal compiler) but looks and feels quite different. An extreme example of this is [Python++](https://github.com/wmww/Python-plus-plus), where many of these ideas originated. `#define EVIL` was created to split out and clean up the reusable bits of Python++.

<div align="right"> 
<a href="#projects-titles"> 📚 </a>
</div>

#

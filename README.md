# C++ Projects **PlayGround**

### I made this repo to make more C++ projects and implement new things I always wanted to try.

### **This repo** will contain some forked,cloned repo from other people, their credit will be found every *README* of each directory and it will edited to my need.

### This will include some projects that I want to look into when I have time.

### I hope this repository never stops growing, and teaches me new things about this fascinating programming language.

#### **I also hope in feeding back to it**

Update, made two related screen savers with C-programming language(Pipes_ScreenSaver)(Matrix_ScreenSaver), also training with some algorithms in the SimpleCode directory, this will be helpful.

# C++ Projects **PlayGround** #

### I made this repo to make more C++ projects and implement new things I always wanted to try

### **This repo** will contain some forked or cloned repos from other users, their credit will be found in every *README* of each directory and it will be edited to my need

### I hope this repository never stops growing and teaches me new things about this fascinating programming language

## Overview
This repository serves as a personal playground for experimenting with various C++ projects. It includes original implementations, as well as forked or cloned repositories from other developers with my own improvements as fits. Each project aims to explore different concepts and features of the C++ programming language.


### Side note:
Projects are organized alphabetically for easy navigation. Each corresponding *README* file provides specific details, usage instructions, and credits for any borrowed code.

## Projects

### [Atrai-Games](./Atari-Games)

A collection of classic Atari games implemented in C++:

1. 2048 - [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game))

2. Snake - [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre))

3. Tetris - [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris)
#

### [Beneficial-C_programming](./Benfetial-C_programming)
*Compile and execute C "scripts" in one go!*

 A shell script designed to streamline the process of compiling and executing C (and C++) scripts with unparalleled speed. This tool allows users to run C code directly from the command line or via shebang, making it as convenient as running shell scripts. With support for multiple files and customizable compiler options.
#

### [canChat](./canChat)
Feature-complete rooms-based chat for tens of thousands of users. Client plus Server. Built with [Oat++ Web Framework](https://oatpp.io/).
`Single-Node` `In-Memory` `WebSocket` `TLS`.

#
### [Chess_3D](./Chess_3D)

A simple 3D chess game that depends on GLFW and GLM, with U-R-C-F for game controls.

#
### [CPP20_Develop](./CPP20_Develop)

`A versatile collection of compile-time optimized tools for C++ programming.`

This library uses the latest C++ features available in GCC, Clang and Visual Studio 2019 and 2022.

#

### [Chess-Engine](./Chess_Engine)

Chess Engine in C++17.
#

### [Collatz-Conjecture](./Collatz)

[Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) about Collatz Conjecture.

A program that attempts to solve Collatz-Conjecture question which asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one.

#

### [CustomizedOperators](./CustomizedOperators)

Implements custom operators for C++.
#### Like what?
In C++ one can not create new operators such as <> or |&. What you can do however is create a variable named x of newly created type with irrelevant name and overload the operators < and > such that you can write <x> creating a new operators of sorts.
#

### [Demystifying_Guard](./Demystifying_Guard)
Demystifying PatchGuard is a comprehensive analysis of Microsoft's security feature called PatchGuard, which is designed to prevent unauthorized modifications to the Windows kernel. The analysis is done through practical engineering, with a focus on understanding PatchGuard's inner workings. 
#

### [Dump C++](./Dump_c%2B%2B)
#
### [FileLockSocket](./FileLockSocket)

Transfer files quickly and securely! 

The project utilizes [PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) for key derivation, employs AES-256-GCM for encryption/decryption, and uses [SHA3-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3) for integrity check.

Update, made two related screen savers with C-programming language(Pipes_ScreenSaver)(Matrix_ScreenSaver), and also trained with some algorithms in the SimpleCode directory, this will be helpful.

Added the Marble Marcher game(MarbleMarcher) which has been made by the Code-Paradoy YouTube channel and changed some things to it.

Made template for c/c++ library or executed files(Template_Language_Generator), support desing modules(support_modules),System Cpu Monitor(SystemMonitor),tokenizer for c/c++, terminal file manager(tfm)

Made a shell with c low-level programming language.(miniShell)

Pushed (Dump_c++) doc and (ModerCLI) which I don't own, left the credits in the markdown file.

Made custom operator with C++ for customizing my needs.(CustomizedOperator)

Pushed a header file that brings reflection to any class that wants it, regardless of
whether the reflected member is a constant(introspective)

Finished the Word Processor with qt5 finally(WordProc)

Building an improved version of c++ 19/20 for my uses(CPP20Develop)

Trying with some simple game engine trying to figure out things on my own(simple_turso)=finished

Added a similar javascript interpreter(javascript-compiler)

Customized a C_programming language(Benefetial-C_programming)

Added simple thread wrapper for easier multiThreading(ofxAsync)

Added simple async thread pool implementation(Thread_Pool)

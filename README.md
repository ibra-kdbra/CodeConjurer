# C++ Projects **PlayGround**

So I made this repo to make more c++ projects and implement new things I always wanted to try

**This repo** will also contain some forked repo from other people that I will give their credit in every *README* of it's directory and I will edit them to my need.

I will also put some projects that I want to look into when I have time.

I hope this repo never stop to grow and teach new things I love about this super programming language

**I also hope in feeding back to it**

Update, I'm finishing some c++ code to add, maybe another game later also

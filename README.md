# C++ Projects **PlayGround** #

## I made this repo to make more C++ projects and implement new things I always wanted to try

### **This repo** will contain some forked or cloned repos from other users, their credit will be found in every *README* of each directory and it will be edited to my need

### I hope this repository never stops growing and teaches me new things about this fascinating programming language

#
# Overview
This repository serves as a personal playground for experimenting with various C++ projects. It includes original implementations, as well as forked or cloned repositories from other developers with my own improvements as fits. Each project aims to explore different concepts and features of the C++ programming language.


## Side note:
Projects are organized alphabetically for easy navigation. Each project directory contains its own README.md file, which provides specific details, usage instructions, and credits for any borrowed code.

## Beneficial-C_programming [link](https://github.com/ibra-kdbra/Cpp_Projects/tree/main/Benfetial-C_programming)

 `Compile and execute C "scripts" in one go!`

 A shell script designed to streamline the process of compiling and executing C (and C++) scripts with unparalleled speed. This tool allows users to run C code directly from the command line or via shebang, making it as convenient as running shell scripts. With support for multiple files and customizable compiler options.

#
## CPP20_Develop [link](https://github.com/ibra-kdbra/Cpp_Projects/tree/main/CPP20_Develop)

`A versatile collection of compile-time optimized tools for C++ programming.`

This library uses the latest C++ features available in GCC, Clang and Visual Studio 2019 and 2022.

#

## Chess_3D [link](https://github.com/ibra-kdbra/Cpp_Projects/tree/main/Chess_3D)

A simple 3d chess game.
#

## Chess-Engine [link](https://github.com/ibra-kdbra/Cpp_Projects/tree/main/Chess_Engine)

Chess Engine in C++17.
#

## Collatz-Conjecture [link](https://github.com/ibra-kdbra/Cpp_Projects/tree/main/Collatz)

#### What does it mean?
The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one.

#

## CustomizedOperators [link](https://github.com/ibra-kdbra/Cpp_Projects/tree/main/CustomizedOperators)

Implements custom operators for C++.
#### Like what?
In C++ one can not create new operators such as <> or |&. What you can do however is create a variable named x of newly created type with irrelevant name and overload the operators < and > such that you can write <x> creating a new operators of sorts.

# C++ Projects **PlayGround**

So I made this repo to make more C++ projects and implement new things I always wanted to try.

**This repo** will also contain some forked repo from other people, I will give their credit in every *README* of its directory and I will edit them to my need.

I will also put some projects that I want to look into when I have time.

I hope this repo never stops growing and teaches me new things about this super programming language.

**I also hope in feeding back to it**

Update, Two games have been added, and I made two related screen savers with C-programming language, also training with some algorithms in the SimpleCode directory, this will be helpful.
I also added the Marble Marcher game which has been made by the Code-Paradoy youtube channel and changed some things to it.

*Note:* I'm starting to like this.

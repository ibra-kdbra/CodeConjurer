# Regular Expression Convertors

## Overview

Kleene's Theorem states that:
> Every language defined by a regular expression is also defined by a Finite Automaton.

This means we can convert regular expressions into finite automata, allowing for powerful pattern recognition capabilities.

## What is a Regular Expression?

A **regular expression** (often abbreviated as **regex** or **regexp**) is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern in text. For more in-depth information. ([Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression))

## Why Convert Regular Expressions into Finite Automata?

Converting regular expressions into finite automata is akin to transforming patterns into machines that can recognize specific words. This process enables programmers to create tools for identifying text patterns and enhances our understanding of languages.

## How to Use

Each subdirectory contains its own *README* file, with detailed instructions. Below is a quick navigation list of the converters:


- Regular Expression to Deterministic Finite Automata [▶️](./RE-to-DFA/)
- Regular Expression to Non-deterministic Finite Automata [▶️](./RE-to-NFA/)
- Regular Expression to Epsilon Non-deterministic Finite Automata [▶️](./RE-to-E-NFA/)

Feel free to explore each converter and enhance your understanding of regular expressions and finite automata!
